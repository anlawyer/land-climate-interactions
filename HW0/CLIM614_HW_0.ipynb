    "1. Now the day-to-day variability in the surface energy budget can be seen. First, study only at the \"uncorrected\" flux panel - there are some systematic behaviors between variables (\"on days when variable A does this, variable B usually does that\"). Comment on what you see.\n",
    "2. Now do the same for the imbalance - do you see any systematic behaviors, either within the diurnal cycle, or across different kinds of days? Explain what you see.\n",
    "3. With a full month of data, you now have a fairly stable estimate of the bias and RMSE for the energy balance with uncorrected versus corrected heat fluxes. Now would you say the \"correction\" improve the bias? What about the root-mean-square-error (RMSE)? Comment on what the correction appears to address well, and what it does not. How might this affect your use of the data?"
