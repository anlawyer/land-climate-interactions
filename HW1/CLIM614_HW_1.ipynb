    "In this assignment and several of the subsequent assignments, we will be using the [**MetPy**](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html) package. It is a library of Python functions for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations with weather data. One of the features of **MetPy** is that it uses [**Pint**](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which assigns units to variables and arrays. Thus, **MetPy** will raise an error any time units do not agree, which can be tedious but is an excellent way to ensure calculations are done correctly and bugs are discovered. Units are assigned to a variable or array by multiplying it by the `units` function with the appropriate argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "`freezing = 273.15 * units.K` \n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "`freezing = 273.15 * units('K')`\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice feature is that it will sort out mixed mode units as long as the dimensions agree. For example, `1*units('cm') + 1*units('inch')` will return 3.54 cm, but `1*units('cm') + 1*units('minute')` will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of valid units and their abbreviations can be found in the **Pint** [definitions file](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt)."

    "## A. Conduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduction is a transfer or flux down gradient within a matrix of matter, from high to low values. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$q = -k \\frac{dS}{dz}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $q$ is the flux - a measure of the rate of conduction.\n",
    "* $S$ can be any state variable, e.g., temperature.\n",
    "* $k$ is a *conductivity*, one of two factors that determines how quickly conductions occurs. It governs the magnitude of the flux, and is usually tied to properties of the *matrix of matter*.\n",
    "* $z$ is a unit distance in the direction of the net flux. Fluxes may be going on in all directions, but summed up there will be predominant direction, a vector of the flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dS}{dz}$ defines a *gradient* of $S$ in the $z$ direction, which is the other factor determining the rate of conduction. Conduction is proportional to the magnitude of the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the reciprocal of a *conductivity* or *conductance* is a *resistance*: $r=1/k$. Depending on the application you may see either, or both, terms used.  \n",

How might you change the set-up to make it more realistic?"

    "A classic problem in land-atmosphere interactions is the relationship between day-to-day changes in soil moisture and surface heat fluxes, especially latent heat flux (i.e., evaporation). A strong positive correlation between the two indicates soil moisture availability is controlling evaporation. A significant negative correlation means evaporation is limited by available energy (sunlight, warmth of the air) and not moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use daily observations from a flux tower near Tucson, Arizona to measure sensitivity of surface fluxes to soil moisture during summer. Southeastern Arizona is at the northern edge of the North American monsoon system, so it was a summer rainy season usually starting in July, and is very dry from October to May or June. We will use measurements of soil moisture near the surface, since the vegetation is limited and most of the evaporation is directly from the soil surface. For the flux variable, we will use evaporative fraction (EF):\n",
    "$$ EF = \\frac{\\lambda E}{\\lambda E\\ + H}$$\n",
    "$\\lambda E$ is the latent heat flux and $H$ is sensible heat flux. EF is the fraction of available energy (net radiation minus heat flux into the ground) that goes to evaporating the soil moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C.1 Scatter diagram of daily means\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at the data for JJA across all years in the dataset. We'll plot each month separately so we can get a picture of how soil moisture and evaporation change as we move through the start of the monsoon season.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the code cell below to look at other months as well."

    "### C.2 Linear statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "To define correlations and sensitivites, we need to define mean conditions for each variable (their climatologies), and deviations from the mean (anomalies). Because we see pronounced changes from month to month, reflecting the seasonal evolution of these quantities, we need to be careful how we define climatological means, anomalies, etc.  The seasonal cycle is a natural feature and not itself an \"anomaly\", so we would like to define anomalies relative to the seasonal cycle. There are a number of ways to do that - we will choose a relatively simple approach by treating each month separately, comparing Julys only to other Julys, Augusts to other Augusts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also employ a convenience possible from the definitions of linear statistics of means, variances, standard deviations, covariances, correlations and linear regressions. By calculating 5 basic terms up front, we can derive all the other statistics from combinations of these 5 terms:\n",
    "* Mean of soil moisture $\\overline{SM}$\n",
    "* Mean of soil moisture squared $\\overline{SM^2}$\n",
    "* Mean of evaporative fraction $\\overline{EF}$\n",
    "* Mean of evaporative fraction squared $\\overline{EF^2}$\n",
    "* Mean of soil moisture times evaporative fraction $\\overline{SM \\cdot EF}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With these terms, we can calculate many other statistics, including the following:\n",
    "* Variance (e.g., of $SM$): $ \\sigma^2(SM) = \\overline{SM^2} - \\overline{SM}^2$\n",
    "* Standard deviation: $ \\sigma(SM) = \\sqrt{\\overline{SM^2} - \\overline{SM}^2}$\n",
    "* Coefficient of variation: $ \\frac{\\sigma(SM)}{\\overline{SM}}$\n",
    "* Covariance: $ cov(SM,EF) = \\overline{SM \\cdot EF} - \\overline{SM}\\cdot\\overline{EF}$\n",
    "* Correlation: $ R(SM,EF) = \\frac{cov(SM,EF)}{\\sigma(SM) \\cdot \\sigma(EF)}$\n",
    "* Slope of EF regressed on SM (a.k.a. sensitivity of EF to SM): $ S(SM,EF) = \\frac{cov(SM,EF)}{\\sigma^2(SM)}$\n",
    "* Intercept: $I(SM,EF) = \\overline{EF} - S(SM,EF) \\cdot \\overline{SM}$\n",
    "* Coupling index: $ CI(SM,EF) = \\frac{cov(SM,EF)}{\\sigma(SM)} = R(SM,EF) \\cdot \\sigma(EF) = S(SM,EF) \\cdot \\sigma(SM)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is extremely useful when you are dealing with very large datasets that take a long time to read through. You can process the data in one pass to calculate and save the 5 basic statistics as a much smaller data set, and then use it to derive many other statistics."

What does it mean that the two quantities increase together month-by-month? And why do you think EF continues to increase in August after soil moisture has plateaued - physically what is going on? \n",
